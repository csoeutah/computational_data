# computational_data
This repo contains computational data (Density Functional Theory Calculations and Ab initio Molecular Dynamics and Classical Dynamics Simulations) generated as part of the Center for Synthetic Organic Electrochemistry (https://cci.utah.edu/).
The data includes raw data such as different input, parameters, and output files, as well as data on redox potentials, bond dissociation energies, etc. for use by synthetic (electro)chemists.
